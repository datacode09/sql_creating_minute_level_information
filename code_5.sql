--Here's a query that uses the TRUNC and GROUP BY functions to regularize a table 
--with non-uniform timestamps to 1-min interval timestamps and get the count of agent ids per status value:

SELECT TRUNC(timestamp, 'MI') AS one_min_interval,
       agent_status AS status,
       COUNT(agent_id) AS count_of_agentid_per_status
FROM input_table
GROUP BY TRUNC(timestamp, 'MI'), agent_status;

--In this query, TRUNC is used to truncate the timestamp column to the nearest minute ('MI'), which rounds the timestamp down to the nearest minute interval. The resulting truncated timestamp is used as the first output column.

--The second output column is the agent_status column from the input table.

--The third output column is the count of agent ids per status value, which is obtained using the COUNT function on the agent_id column.

--The GROUP BY clause groups the rows based on the truncated timestamp and agent status, and the aggregate function COUNT is applied to each group to get the count of agent ids per status value.
