SELECT 
  LEVEL, 
  TO_CHAR(SYSDATE + ((LEVEL-1) * INTERVAL '1' DAY), 'DD-MON-YYYY') AS "DATE"
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 7;

In this query, we're selecting the level (i.e. the depth in the hierarchy) and a date that is calculated based on the current system date and the level using the "interval" keyword. We're using "connect by" to create a hierarchy of rows that are each one level deeper than the previous row, up to a maximum of 7 levels.

Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the query:

LEVEL: This is a built-in pseudo-column in Oracle that indicates the depth of each row in the hierarchy. In this case, it will range from 1 to 7 because we've limited the hierarchy to 7 levels with the "CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 7" clause.

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE + ((LEVEL-1) * INTERVAL '1' DAY), 'DD-MON-YYYY'): This is a function that calculates a date based on the current system date and the level of the row in the hierarchy. We're using the "INTERVAL '1' DAY" keyword to add one day to the current date for each level. The "TO_CHAR" function is used to convert the date to a string in the format 'DD-MON-YYYY'.

FROM DUAL: This is a dummy table in Oracle that we're using to generate rows for our hierarchy.

CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 7: This is a clause that specifies the hierarchical relationship between rows in the query. We're using "CONNECT BY" to indicate that each row is one level deeper than the previous row, and we're limiting the hierarchy to 7 levels with the "LEVEL <= 7" condition.
